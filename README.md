## What even is this code bro?
This was a coding exercise I did for my CCPROG1 class, and I lowkey put wayyyy too much unnecessary time  
on the aesthetics but who caaaares right? At least it looks hella pretty now :3

### Specifications and how to run
You can run this on anything that runs C:
* Notepad++
* DevC++ IDE
* Visual Code Studio
* etc.

Just download the two files and run the ```run.exe``` file and everything should run as it should.

## Can I use this code?
I mean... yeah? It's not like I'm gonna gatekeep it lol.  
Feel free to use this as reference for certain projects if you are a beginner looking to try coding.
Or you can just... admire the weird ass code? Idk what you people do in your free time but I don't judge ig  

*(also please don't judge my code cause I really am not that advanced at the time of writing this lol)*
